All my small projects from presentations and demos, that are too small to have their own project.

At the moment are hosted here:

Application Settings Demo
> A demo showing how to create an options screen in a Windows Client application and then use a IApplicationSettings interface to pass those settings a library.
Serial Port Demo
> A demo showing how to use the Serial-Port object to do serial communications.  This demo requires a Serial to USB loop-back cable to run.
Syndication Demo
> A demo showing how to use the Syndication object from .NET 3.5 Windows Communication Foundation.
